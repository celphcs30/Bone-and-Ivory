	<description>Bone and Ivory introduces the coveted Ivory material, prized for its quality akin to jade. Butchering wild boars yields 2 ivory while processing elephant tusks or thrumbo horns at a stonecutter provides significant amounts.

		Enhancing vanilla features: Retexture and rotatable functionality for the Skullspike!

		Delve into macabre décor with:

		Tall Torch, crafted from four skulls, perpetually ablaze without need for refueling.
		Double Skull Spike, two skulls mounted for an eerie display.


		For flooring options:

		Skull Pathway, your pathway for conquest.
		Skull Floors, a grisly foundation.
		Fine Skull Floor, an opulent luxury, albeit costly.


		For imposing structures:

		Walls crafted entirely from skulls, striking fear into the hearts of onlookers.


		Explore the depths of your morbid creativity with Bone and Ivory.</description>
