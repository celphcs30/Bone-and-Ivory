# Bone and Ivory

A RimWorld mod that adds macabre decorative items, ivory crafting, and bone-based structures.

## Original Mod

This mod is an updated continuation of the abandoned mod **"SWR's Skulls and Ivory"** by **Homeless Emperor** (She Wants Revenge).

**Original Steam Workshop**: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3169742181

The original mod was abandoned after RimWorld 1.4 and has been updated for RimWorld 1.6 compatibility with improvements and bug fixes.

## Description

Bone and Ivory introduces the coveted Ivory material, prized for its quality akin to jade. Butchering wild boars yields 2 ivory while processing elephant tusks or thrumbo horns at a stonecutter provides significant amounts.

Enhancing vanilla features: Retexture and rotatable functionality for the Skullspike!

Delve into macabre décor with:

- **Tall Torch**, crafted from four skulls, perpetually ablaze without need for refueling.
- **Double Skull Spike**, two skulls mounted for an eerie display.

For flooring options:

- **Skull Pathway**, your pathway for conquest.
- **Skull Floors**, a grisly foundation.
- **Fine Skull Floor**, an opulent luxury, albeit costly.

For imposing structures:

- **Walls crafted entirely from skulls**, striking fear into the hearts of onlookers.

Explore the depths of your morbid creativity with Bone and Ivory.
